PyXLL Examples: Object Cache

Excel cells hold basic types (strings, numbers, booleans etc) but sometimes
it can be useful to have functions that take and return objects and to be
able to call those functions from Excel.

This example shows how a custom type ('cached_object') and an object cache
can be used to pass objects between functions using PyXLL.

It also shows how COM events can be used to remove items from
the object cache when they are no longer needed.
